      <p>...as the write-in candidate for EmpireJS 2016 this May 26th and 27th. Every year the Empire team ramps up we try to highlight one of the things that makes New York City an amazing place to live, work, visit, and <code>git push origin master</code> in.</p>

      <p>This year we return to showcase the little language you know and love at the National Museum of the American Indian.</p>

      <p>This historical election year won't be the only thing making headlines. We're so excited that we're able to feature New York at its finest, and we're really looking forward to pushing EmpireJS towards another incredible year.</p>
